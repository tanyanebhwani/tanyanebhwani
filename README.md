# About Me

Hello! I'm Tanya, a passionate web developer and recent MCA graduate, with a strong foundation in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). My curiosity for how websites solve real-life problems drives me to create impactful and innovative web solutions. 

Recently, I’ve developed a keen interest in statistics and machine learning, using data-driven insights to make predictions and inform smarter applications. My technical toolbox also includes SQL and MySQL, empowering me to manage and query databases efficiently.

## Favorite Projects

- **ISL-Organised**: Leveraged spatiotemporal CNNs to accurately detect dynamic Indian Sign Language signs/words.
- **Urban Mobility Planner** & **iNotebook**: Full-stack web applications featuring:
  - UI design with React
  - Route and authentication management via Node.js
  - Secure password encryption (bcryptjs) and JWT-based authentication
  - Backend APIs with Express and MongoDB (using Mongoose ODM)
  - Effective state management with React Context API

Each project reflects my commitment to robust architecture, intuitive user experience, and secure data handling.

## More About Me

When I’m not coding, I enjoy watching informative podcasts, journaling, and exploring philosophy. These hobbies help me stay curious, reflective, and motivated to keep learning.

## Color Theme Suggestion: Slate Blue & Mint Green

For a professional yet distinctive look, I recommend a theme using:
- **Slate Blue** (#5B5F97) for headers and accent elements
- **Mint Green** (#7FFFD4) for highlights and call-to-action buttons
- **Soft White** (#F7F7F7) as the background
- **Charcoal Gray** (#2D3142) for text

This palette is modern, easy on the eyes, and will make your portfolio stand out while retaining a professional appearance.
